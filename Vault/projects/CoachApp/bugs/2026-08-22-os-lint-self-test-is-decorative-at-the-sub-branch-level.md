# `os-lint --self-test` proves a check produced *a* RED, not that the detector under test works

Built 2026-08-21 specifically to answer "does this alarm still have batteries?", after `gates-fired`
sat GREEN for weeks while structurally incapable of failing. It has the same defect one level down.

## Proven, not reasoned

`checkMemory` contains several independent detectors: frontmatter validity, name-vs-filename drift,
near-miss wikilinks, index consistency both ways, JSONL parseability. Its fixture (`memDir()`) trips
**two** of them at once — a name/filename mismatch *and* an index entry pointing at a missing file.

Neutering **only** the name-mismatch branch:

```
BITES       memory
19/19 checks proven to fire on a corpus that should trip them.
```

The detector is dead, and the self-test says the check bites — because the ghost-index detector still
fires and the assertion only greps for `RED memory`.

## The shape

This is precisely the defect found in the app the same day
(`2026-08-22-guard-verifies-one-id-while-the-write-keys-on-another`): **verifying one fact while the
thing that matters is another.** The self-test verifies "this check emitted RED". What matters is
"the specific detector I aimed at emitted RED".

Every multi-detector check is affected. `checkMemory` (5 detectors), `checkHooks` (3: missing script,
unregistered script, invalid JSON), `checkBugFrontmatter` (3: status, priority, reported),
`checkLiveDocs` (2: retired terms, dead paths), `checkDeadTools` (2: preview_* regex, allowlist).
**Roughly half the suite's detectors are unproven.** A single-detector check like `checkCorpora` is
genuinely covered; the rest are covered only in aggregate.

## Fix direction

Assert on the RED **message**, not just the check name. Each spec gains an expected substring — the
memory name-mismatch fixture asserts `does not match its filename`, the ghost-index fixture asserts
`points at`, and so on — which forces one fixture per detector rather than one per check. That turns
`19/19 checks` into something like `19 checks / ~35 detectors`, and the count becoming honest is the
point.

**Closes when:** neutering any single detector turns its own spec DECORATIVE, proven for at least the
five multi-detector checks named above.
