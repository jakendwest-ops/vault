## 2026-06-27 — Runner feature pack + regression fixes + Playwright hardening (v134)

### What was done
- **Timed sets:** Template builder shows Duration (mm:ss) field when Timed toggle active. Runner shows duration log field and validates before logging. `flushTemplateSets` already handled the field; runner `logRunnerSet()` checks `tgt.timed` first.
- **Unilateral L/R logging:** When a set's `sets_json` has `unilateral: true`, runner shows separate Left/Right columns (weight + reps each). `setData` carries `leftWeight/leftReps/rightWeight/rightReps`. Frontend-only change, no schema change.
- **Client "My Programs" accordion:** `renderClientWorkoutsPage()` now queries `client_programs` with full phase/workout structure and `workout_template_exercises`. Shows phases that expand to session rows (exercise count + day). Start button on right. Falls back to flat template list if no program assigned.
- **Runner UI redesign:** (1) Set X of Y in header, (2) reps/weight target visible below exercise name, (3) PT notes always shown with `[Label]` prefix stripped, (4) per-exercise client notes textarea stored on `_runner.exercises[i].clientNotes`, (5) visible "✎ Edit" button on logged sets, (6) scrollable logged-sets area.
- **Skip rest bug fixed:** `skipRestTimer()` was clearing the rest overlay but never calling `renderRunner()` for between-sets rests (where `_afterRest` is null). Fix: `else if (_runner) renderRunner()` added at end of function.
- **Client session detail regression fixed:** New `renderClientWorkoutsPage` had removed the old expandable session detail. Fixed by: adding `workout_template_exercises` to the query, making session name tap-to-expand via `toggleClientPhase(detailId)`, rendering exercise list in hidden panel.
- **Client notes schema:** `workout_log_exercises.client_notes text` — SQL migration written; Jake must run it manually.
- **Playwright tests strengthened:**
  - `skip rest clears rest overlay and restores input fields` — now asserts: overlay gone, "Resting" text absent, LOG button visible. Would have caught the skip rest bug.
  - `client can tap session name to see exercise list` — asserts exercise detail panel opens on tap. Would have caught the session detail regression.
  - Fixed stale `text=START A WORKOUT` assertion (renamed to `h1` containing "Workouts").
  - `beforeEach` in runner tests now expands first phase panel if accordion is present, ensuring Start buttons are visible.
  - All 15 tests green.

### Decisions
- **client_notes stored per exercise, not per set** — logging context (feeling, cue) is exercise-level. Set-level is covered by weight/reps data. Per-exercise textarea is simpler and sufficient for v1.
- **Accordion tests are conditional** — if test client has no program assigned, accordion tests skip gracefully. Consequence: these tests are currently no-ops for the Playwright test client. Fixing this requires assigning a program to the test client, which is a manual step.
- **Timed/unilateral are frontend-only changes** — no schema changes needed. Both flags live in `sets_json` already. This is the correct architectural decision: set metadata belongs in the template's JSON, not as separate columns.

### Revisit-if
- Client notes will silently fail until Jake runs the SQL migration. First symptom: `client_notes` column missing → Supabase returns error → `saveRunnerSession` logs the error but the session saves anyway (partial data).
- Timed sets and unilateral UI are unverified on live site. Smoke test needed after next push.
- Playwright accordion tests are conditional — if test client gets a program assigned in future, the condition will start running real assertions and may surface bugs.

### Regressions surfaced this session
- **Skip rest**: `skipRestTimer()` had no `renderRunner()` call after clearing between-sets rest. Fixed. Playwright guard added.
- **Client session detail**: Replacing `renderClientWorkoutsPage` removed the expandable session row pattern. Fixed by re-adding expand with `toggleClientPhase`. Playwright guard added.
- **Root cause of both**: Redesigning a page without asking "what did the old code show that the new code now hides?" Both failures would have been caught by the regression-sweep habit. Jake confirmed both could have been prevented — "yes" answer to "could both have been prevented?".

## 2026-06-25 — Runner redesign, role-specific nav, My Progress page (v110)

### What was done
- **Role-specific nav:** Replaced static nav HTML with `renderNav(role)` function. PT gets 6 items; client gets 4 (Dashboard, Workouts, Progress, Settings). `_NAV_ICONS` and `_NAV_ITEMS` objects define each role's nav. `applyRoleUI()` now calls `renderNav()` on login.
- **Compact runner input area:** Replaced 3-column grid layout with single flex row — Set N (left column) | Kg input (flex:1) | Reps input (flex:1) | LOG button + skip/finish. Inputs reduced from `font-size:28px` to `22px`, padding from `10px` to `6px`. 
- **Last session strip:** Added persistent `#wr-last-session` div above the stats bar in runner (for non-cardio exercises). `fetchRunnerLastSession(exName)` uses a two-query pattern (logs by client_id → exercises by log_id). Shows "Last · 24 Jun  S1 80kg×8  S2 80kg×8" style.
- **Next exercise moved to header subtitle** — removed the "Next up" card from the scrollable set log area; added a one-liner `Next: <exercise name>` below the exercise name in the header.
- **Runner chart fully removed** — `fetchRunnerExHistory` and `drawRunnerChart` deleted. Progress data now lives in My Progress page where it belongs.
- **My Progress page (client):** 4-tab shell with `renderProgressWeight`, `renderProgressStrength`, `renderProgressCardio`, `renderProgressPBs`. `navigate()` updated with `case 'progress'` route. Body Weight tab renders Chart.js weight chart. Strength tab uses `workout_logs!inner` join to filter by client. Cardio and PBs tabs structured but thin.
- **Template edit/delete guard:** Added `.eq('coach_id', currentUser.id).select()` and row-count check to `saveEditTemplate` and `deleteTemplate`. Silent RLS failures now surface as user-visible errors.
- **Sounding board protocol:** Jake asked to be challenged on new feature ideas before building. Memory saved; now applies to all new feature requests this session onward.
- **Pushed to production:** d1d4377 → master → GitHub Pages.

### Decisions
- **My Progress page is the home for all historic client data** — not the runner, not the client dashboard. Charts in the runner were distracting during a workout; progress review belongs in a dedicated page. Jake proposed this; confirmed he wanted Body Weight / Strength / Cardio / PBs tabs.
- **Role-specific nav solves the overflow problem cleanly** — rather than hiding items, each role gets a purpose-built nav set. No CSS overrides, no hidden elements.
- **Last session strip is persistent (not in empty state)** — initially rendered in the "no sets yet" empty state; Jake asked for it to be above the stats bar persistently so it's always visible during the set.

### Revisit-if
- My Progress Strength tab uses PostgREST `workout_logs!inner` join with `.eq('workout_logs.client_id', ...)`. If this returns no data on production, the filter syntax may need to be `.eq('workout_logs.client_id', ...)` → PostgREST embedded filter format. Check Supabase API logs after first live test.
- `performance_logs` RLS for clients: current policies may not cover this table for client SELECT. Check if Personal Bests tab errors on live.

## 2026-06-25 — Programs feature + modal layout fix

### What was done
- **Programs full build (v94):** Phases UI already existed; added assign-template-to-day workflow, "Assign to client" button + modal on program builder, weekly schedule card on client dashboard with today highlighted + ▶ Start button that launches the workout runner with the correct template. Verified end-to-end: Jake's program (12-Week Strength Block) assigned to Jake West client, dashboard showed Mon/Wed/Thu workouts, Start button launched runner.
- **Critical layout bug fixed (v95):** Program builder page showed two copies of page side-by-side on desktop. Root cause: `apc-modal` was embedded as static HTML inside `openProgram`'s `el.innerHTML`. Unstyled because it used `class="modal-box"` (doesn't exist in main.css; correct class is `modal`). Fixed by converting to dynamic body-level modal creation (matching `showAssignProgramModal` pattern). Also fixed `modal-box` → `modal` in `openProgram` and `renderPrograms` modals.
- **Preview resize confusion:** Resized preview to 1200px for desktop test, forgot to resize back. Jake reported "two pages still rendering" — was the normal sidebar + main content desktop layout, not a rendering bug. Resized back to 480×844.

### Decisions
- **Dynamic modal pattern is the standard:** Any modal must be created via `document.createElement` + appended to `document.body`, never as static HTML in `el.innerHTML`. Reason: static modals inside `#main-content` (which has `overflow-y:auto`) interfere with fixed positioning. Pattern source: `showAssignProgramModal` line ~942.
- **`modal` not `modal-box`:** `.modal-box` does not exist in main.css. All modal inner containers must use `class="modal"`. Reason: wrong class = no CSS = unstyled overlay that breaks layout.

### Revisit-if
- Desktop layout at >768px viewport needs a full UX review pass — cards may not stretch to full main-content width. Not confirmed yet.
- Assign-to-client modal not verified on live site — only in preview.

v95 — pushed and deployed to GitHub Pages.
