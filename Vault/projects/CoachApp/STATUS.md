## What's working (verified)

- Auth — login / signup (with consent checkbox) / invite accept / session persistence
- PT dashboard — stats row, recent activity, compliance cards, goals due; business name in subtitle when branding set
- Client management — list, add, profile tabs (Overview / Goals / Workouts / Weight / Performance / Programs / Photos / 1RMs), edit, invite, resend
- Workout templates — create / edit / delete / add exercises / log
- Set form — AMRAP, Unilateral, Timed, Reps, Weight, %1RM, Rest, RPE/RIR, Tempo, Notes
- Cardio set form — Pace, HR Zone, Rest, Stroke rate, Duration, Distance
- Template card set preview — correct for all set types including timed (1:30 not 90 reps)
- Workout runner — set-by-set flow, timed sets, unilateral L/R, rest timer, skip rest, last session strip
- Edit logged sets in runner; PT notes always shown; client notes textarea
- Runner save lands on correct page per role (client → Workouts, PT → client profile)
- Client dashboard — hero "Up next" card (program + phase + week), goals, weight, upcoming events, PBs, recent sessions; PT branding header when set
- PT dashboard — hero card, stats strip, two-column grid, activity feed (coach-scoped, no solo bleed), compliance cards, goals due
- Solo dashboard — hero card, stats strip (hidden on mobile), two-column grid
- Sudo/impersonation mode — "View as" button on client list (email-gated), amber banner, exit restores PT view
- Progress tabs — Body Weight and Personal Bests tabs have add buttons; Cardio explains auto-population
- Programs — create / edit / delete / phases / assign template to day / assign to client / edit start date / remove
- Edit sessions directly from Programs page (backFn context pattern)
- Program phases: client plan clones have program_id: null (bug fixed 2026-06-28)
- Client programs accordion — phase → day → SESSION N/M → exercise list → Start button
- Calendar — monthly grid, add/delete events; client calendar shows program workouts
- Weight tracking — log, chart, stats row
- Performance / PBs — log, best-per-exercise, chart, delete
- Check-ins — weekly form, history
- Goals — create, edit, milestones, check-ins, due-soon on PT dashboard
- My Progress (client) — 4 tabs: Body Weight, Strength, Cardio, Personal Bests
- View switcher — PT | Client | Personal three-pill for master account (sidebar desktop + mobile); Personal pill shown only when solo client record exists
- Personal (solo) account — Jake's client record severed from PT (coach_id = null); personal dashboard, solo nav, self-assign programs, Workouts shows program session accordion with Start buttons
- Exercise library — add / edit / delete / muscle groups / library dropdown in template exercise editor
- Programs builder — Hyrox Hero (12-week, 4 templates × 12 phases = 48 master templates)
- **Branding** — PT logo upload (private logos bucket, signed URLs), business name, sidebar, PT dashboard, client dashboard
- **Security/GDPR** — private storage buckets, PII-free logs, consent checkbox, data export, delete account (delete_current_user RPC)
- Pre-push hook — 10-check bug scan (JS syntax, column names, query scoping, cache bust, no alert, no hardcoded IDs, no set_type, no swallowed errors, no bare clearInterval, no PII in logs, no timed set guard bypass, no duplicate functions)
- GitHub Actions CI — mirrors pre-push hook
- Playwright E2E — 39 tests (added 8 solo-account tests + session detail slide-in smoke test); 19 smoke tests in pre-push hook
- Delete account — custom modal, typed DELETE confirmation, proper error handling, anchored to top of viewport (no browser dialogs, no clipping when page scrolled)
- XSS protection — `escapeHtml()` applied to all coach-controlled strings in innerHTML
- Session detail slide-in — right-side drawer showing exercises/sets/reps for a session; works in solo and client mode; `position:fixed;inset:0;z-index:1000` wrapper pattern
- `sudoAsClient()` server-side guard — in-function email check prevents DevTools exploitation by non-Jake users
- **DB security hardening** — OpenAPI schema mocked; `lock_created_at` BEFORE UPDATE triggers on 11 tables; `events` UPDATE USING clause fixed; REVOKE EXECUTE on 4 internal functions; `delete_current_user` search_path locked; max_rows 200; auto-expose new tables off; secure password change on; min password 8 chars; Security Advisor: 0 errors

## In progress / known gaps

- **Privacy policy page** — ✅ Done (v158, pushed 2026-06-29) — `/privacy-policy.html` live, consent link updated
- **Personal account (solo view)** — ✅ Done (v158–v162, pushed 2026-06-29) — PT | Personal view switcher, solo dashboard, programs self-assign, Workouts session accordion, RLS policies added
- **Performance logs RLS** — ✅ Done (2026-06-29) — 5 clean policies confirmed via pg_policies query
- **Invite email logo** — PT branding not yet included in invite email HTML (Edge Function not updated)
- **Signed URLs for progress-photos expire after 1hr** — images break in long-lived tabs; acceptable for now
- **My Programs accordion Playwright tests** — conditional (skip if test client has no program). Test client may not have program assigned.
- **My Progress Strength tab** — PostgREST `!inner` join; not verified on live with real data
- **Program builder desktop layout** — cards may not span full width at wider viewports
- **Weekly check-in notification** — always shows Due if >7 days; no dismiss until submitted
- **Solo account Playwright tests** — ✅ 8 smoke tests added (v176); session detail slide-in smoke test added (v179); tests skip gracefully when E2E account has no solo client record

## Continuity block

### Modal pattern — body-level only
All modals: `document.createElement` → `document.body.appendChild`. Never embed in `el.innerHTML`. See `showAssignProgramModal` as canonical pattern. `class="modal-overlay"` wraps `class="modal-box"`.

### `program_id` constraint
Templates with `program_id` set are hidden from flat Workouts list. Client plan clones: `program_id: null`, `client_id: set`. Master templates: `program_id: set`, `client_id: null`. Standalone: both null.

### Timed sets dual format
`s.duration` = `mm:ss` string (from editor). `s.repsMin` = seconds integer string (from programmatic build). Render must handle both. Pattern: `parseRest(s.duration) || parseInt(s.repsMin)`.

### Dynamic nav — event delegation
`renderNav(role)` rewrites `.sidebar-nav` and `.bottom-nav` innerHTML on every call. Click handlers use event delegation on parent containers — never inline onclick on nav items.

### `_runner` global structure
`{ clientId, name, date, exercises, exIdx, startTime, _timerInterval, _restInterval, _afterRest, lastSession }`
Each exercise: `{ name, type, targetSets, targetReps, targetWeight, loggedSets, bodyweight, sets_json, notes, oneRM, clientNotes }`

### `sets_json` flags
`s.timed` → duration field; `s.unilateral` → L/R split; `s.bodyweight` → BW display; `s.amrap` → AMRAP mode

### `_afterRest` pattern
Between-exercise rests: `() => { _runner.exIdx = nextExIdx; renderRunner() }`. Between-set rests: `skipRestTimer()` calls `renderRunner()` directly.

### `_templateCtx` / `_templateGoBack`
Back-nav context for template editor. Always set `backFn` when opening template from non-standard location. `_templateGoBack` checks: `backFn` → `clientId` → `backTo` → default `'workouts'`.

### Save functions own no navigation
`save*` functions save only. Navigation is role-aware at the call site.

### Master account / solo account
`window._masterAccount = true` when coach user has any client record (coached or personal). `window._soloClientId` = personal client record ID (coach_id = null). `window._masterClientId` = coached client record ID (coach_id set). `currentProfile.role` cycles between `'coach'`, `'client'`, `'solo'` via `switchView()`. `localStorage._activeView` persists choice. Client pill only shown when `_masterClientId` set; Personal pill only when `_soloClientId` set.

### Storage — signed URLs
Private buckets: logos (604800s = 7 days), progress-photos (3600s = 1hr). Never `getPublicUrl`. Use `createSignedUrl` (single) or `createSignedUrls` (batch).

### Cache busting
app.js is at `?v=180`. Next commit that changes app.js must bump to `?v=181`.

## Open to-dos for Jake

| Action | Priority |
|---|---|
| **NEXT SESSION: 1RM system — plan approved, ready to build (v181)** — (1) Runner inline 1RM prompt: if no 1RM + %1RM set → orange tap target → bottom sheet with kg input + Epley toggle → saves to client_1rms → live recalc in session. (2) Epley estimator in Add 1RM modal: "I know my 1RM" / "Estimate from a set" toggle → weight × reps → auto-calculates. (3) Big 5 quick-start on empty 1RM tab: Back Squat / Deadlift / Bench / OHP / Barbell Row pre-filled, save all at once. (4) Post-session 1RM suggestion: after save, offer "Save estimated 1RM from today's sets?". No schema changes needed — client_1rms already exists. | **High** |
| Run /deploy-check before next beta invite | **High** |
| Create a solo client record on the E2E PT account so solo-account.spec.js tests stop skipping (all 9 tests skip against E2E account; only pass against Jake's account) | **High** |
| Assign a program to the Playwright test client (coachapp.e2e.client) so accordion tests are not no-ops | High |
| Verify iOS Safari slide-in fix on real device — `inset:0` replaced with explicit `top/right/bottom/left` in v180, pushed. Test on iPhone and close if working. | **High** |
| Run Rowing/Running/SkiErg DELETE SQL in Supabase (safety check first — see below) | High |
| Update invite-client Edge Function to include PT logo in invite email HTML | Medium |
| Test My Progress Strength tab on live with real data | Medium |
| ICO breach notification procedure — document before beta | Medium |
| Verify `workout_template_exercises` RLS policy exists (check pg_policies for that table) | Medium |
| Upgrade Supabase to Pro plan when ready for beta — unlocks leaked password protection (HaveIBeenPwned) | Low |

**Rowing/Running/SkiErg SQL (run in Supabase SQL editor):**
```sql
-- Step 1: safety check — confirm not in use
SELECT e.name, count(wte.id) as in_use
FROM public.exercises e
LEFT JOIN public.workout_template_exercises wte ON wte.exercise_id = e.id
WHERE e.name IN ('Rowing', 'Running', 'SkiErg')
GROUP BY e.name;
-- Step 2 (only if all counts = 0):
DELETE FROM public.exercises WHERE name IN ('Rowing', 'Running', 'SkiErg');
```
