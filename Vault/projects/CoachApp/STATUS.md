## What's working (verified)

- Auth — login / signup (with consent checkbox) / invite accept / session persistence
- PT dashboard — stats row, recent activity, compliance cards, goals due; business name in subtitle when branding set
- Client management — list, add, profile tabs (Overview / Goals / Workouts / Weight / Performance / Programs / Photos / 1RMs), edit, invite, resend
- Workout templates — create / edit / delete / add exercises / log
- Set form — AMRAP, Unilateral, Timed, Reps, Weight, %1RM, Rest, RPE/RIR, Tempo, Notes
- Cardio set form — Pace, HR Zone, Rest, Stroke rate, Duration, Distance
- Template card set preview — correct for all set types including timed (1:30 not 90 reps)
- Workout runner — set-by-set flow, timed sets, unilateral L/R, rest timer, skip rest, last session strip
- **Strength table (Hevy-style)** — plain-strength exercises show an all-sets-visible table (SET/PREVIOUS/KG/REPS/✓) instead of the one-set wizard; previous-session values pre-fill KG/REPS for 1-tap repeat; tap ✓ to complete a set (fires rest timer, non-blocking — table stays visible/editable underneath); uncheck to undo; "+ Add set" appends a row; free-edit any row any time, no forced order. Cardio/timed/unilateral/%1RM exercises stay on the existing wizard (phase 2). v1, shipped 2026-07-02 (6e6402a)
- Edit logged sets in runner; PT notes always shown; client notes textarea
- Runner save lands on correct page per role (client → Workouts, PT → client profile)
- Client dashboard — hero "Up next" card (program + phase + week), goals, weight, upcoming events, PBs, recent sessions; PT branding header when set
- PT dashboard — hero card, stats strip, two-column grid, activity feed (coach-scoped, no solo bleed), compliance cards, goals due
- Solo dashboard — hero card, stats strip (hidden on mobile), two-column grid
- Sudo/impersonation mode — "View as" button on client list (email-gated), amber banner, exit restores PT view
- Progress tabs — Body Weight and Personal Bests tabs have add buttons; Cardio explains auto-population
- Programs — create / edit / delete / phases / assign template to day / assign to client / edit start date / remove
- Edit sessions directly from Programs page (backFn context pattern)
- Program phases: client plan clones have program_id: null (bug fixed 2026-06-28)
- Client programs accordion — phase → day → SESSION N/M → exercise list → Start button
- Calendar — monthly grid, add/delete events; client calendar shows program workouts
- Session history (client Workouts page + PT client-profile Workouts tab) — collapsed behind a toggle by default instead of always showing the full list (2026-07-02)
- Weight tracking — log, chart, stats row
- Performance / PBs — log, best-per-exercise, chart, delete
- Check-ins — weekly form, history
- Goals — create, edit, milestones, check-ins, due-soon on PT dashboard
- My Progress (client) — 4 tabs: Body Weight, Strength, Cardio, Personal Bests
- View switcher — PT | Client | Personal three-pill for master account (sidebar desktop + mobile); Personal pill shown only when solo client record exists
- Personal (solo) account — Jake's client record severed from PT (coach_id = null); personal dashboard, solo nav, self-assign programs, Workouts shows program session accordion with Start buttons
- Exercise library — add / edit / delete / muscle groups / library dropdown in template exercise editor
- Programs builder — Hyrox Hero (12-week, 4 templates × 12 phases = 48 master templates)
- **Branding** — PT logo upload (private logos bucket, signed URLs), business name, sidebar, PT dashboard, client dashboard
- **Security/GDPR** — private storage buckets, PII-free logs, consent checkbox, data export, delete account (delete_current_user RPC)
- Pre-push hook — scans all 8 module files (updated 2026-06-30); JS syntax, column names, query scoping, cache bust, no alert, no hardcoded IDs, no set_type, no swallowed errors, no bare clearInterval, no PII in logs, no timed set guard bypass, no duplicate functions
- GitHub Actions CI — mirrors pre-push hook
- Playwright E2E — 47 tests (40 + 7 new in tests/programs.spec.js on 2026-07-01: periodization Linear/Undulating, 1RM assignment-check missing/have, inline grid render+search, race-guard, create-workout back-link); 19 smoke tests in pre-push hook
- **Codebase modularised** — app.js split into 8 modules: app-core, app-dashboard, app-programs, app-clients, app-calendar-goals, app-workouts, app-runner, app-progress
- Delete account — custom modal, typed DELETE confirmation, proper error handling, anchored to top of viewport (no browser dialogs, no clipping when page scrolled)
- XSS protection — `escapeHtml()` applied to all coach-controlled strings in innerHTML
- Session detail slide-in — right-side drawer showing exercises/sets/reps for a session; works in solo and client mode; `position:fixed;inset:0;z-index:1000` wrapper pattern
- `sudoAsClient()` server-side guard — in-function email check prevents DevTools exploitation by non-Jake users
- **DB security hardening** — OpenAPI schema mocked; `lock_created_at` BEFORE UPDATE triggers on 11 tables; `events` UPDATE USING clause fixed; REVOKE EXECUTE on 4 internal functions; `delete_current_user` search_path locked; max_rows 200; auto-expose new tables off; secure password change on; min password 8 chars; Security Advisor: 0 errors
- **Periodization (Linear / Undulating)** — phase-level %1RM automation; PT builds Week 1 once, picks a scheme, clicks "Generate weeks"; propagates to already-assigned clients automatically; idempotent regeneration; shrinking a phase's week count prunes orphaned generated weeks (2026-07-01)
- **1RM assignment-time check** — when assigning a program, shows which needed %1RM lifts the client is missing, with inline quick-fill (direct kg or Epley estimate); never blocks; covers both assign entry points + solo (2026-07-01)
- **Solo account write access to `client_1rms` and `client_programs`** — fixed a real gap where solo users had no write policy for saving 1RMs or removing/editing an assigned program (silently broken since solo accounts were built); 5 new RLS policies added (2026-07-01)
- **Inline assign-workout grid** — replaced the old "+ Assign workout" modal (day → session → template, one slot at a time) with an always-visible 7-day searchable grid on the phase card; picking a template assigns immediately, no modal, no separate day/session step. Search + exercise-preview hints per option. Picker excludes client-owned clones and periodization-generated week-clones (`generated_from_phase_id` column). Race-condition guard re-checks a slot is still free immediately before inserting. "Create new workout" now returns to the program via a working "Back to program" link instead of stranding the coach (2026-07-01)

## In progress / known gaps

- **Runner redesign → Hevy-style table logger** — ✅ v1 SHIPPED 2026-07-02 (6e6402a). See "What's working" above. **Phase 2 not started:** extend the table pattern (or an equivalent) to cardio/timed/unilateral/%1RM exercises, which still use the old one-set wizard. Two known gaps in v1, not yet resolved: (1) superset auto-switch (wizard jumps to the paired exercise on log; table never auto-advances by design, so a superset pair just sits there until the PT/client manually taps Next — only matters if real templates use `supersetGroup`, not yet checked against Jake's actual data); (2) bodyweight-in-table is code-reviewed but not live-verified (didn't hit a live bodyweight exercise in this session's test data).
- **Runner bug fixes** — ✅ Done (61d8bc7, 2026-07-02): set-counter cap, rest-timer-before-render (×3 branches), beep window 3s→5s, audio-unlock on both entry points. Playwright 48/48 + CI green + deployed. Audio-unlock real-device check deferred by Jake — mobile-web audio is a known limit a native app (Capacitor) will resolve properly.
- **Runner audit (vs the "Hevy" consumer-app bar)** — findings banked to roadmap.md as build items: (1) strength inputs aren't pre-filled → every set is a full retype vs Hevy's 1-tap repeat (biggest gap); (2) no plate calculator; (3) background rest-timer alerts need PWA/native; (4) last-session strip is strength-only. Rationale lives in the LLM wiki `coachapp-product-strategy` + `coachapp-client-app-benchmarks` pages.
- **Privacy policy page** — ✅ Done (v158, pushed 2026-06-29) — `/privacy-policy.html` live, consent link updated
- **Personal account (solo view)** — ✅ Done (v158–v162, pushed 2026-06-29) — PT | Personal view switcher, solo dashboard, programs self-assign, Workouts session accordion, RLS policies added
- **Performance logs RLS** — ✅ Done (2026-06-29) — 5 clean policies confirmed via pg_policies query
- **Invite email logo** — PT branding not yet included in invite email HTML (Edge Function not updated)
- **Signed URLs for progress-photos expire after 1hr** — images break in long-lived tabs; acceptable for now
- **My Programs accordion Playwright tests** — conditional (skip if test client has no program). Test client may not have program assigned.
- **My Progress Strength tab** — PostgREST `!inner` join; not verified on live with real data
- **Program builder desktop layout** — cards may not span full width at wider viewports
- **Weekly check-in notification** — always shows Due if >7 days; no dismiss until submitted
- **Solo account Playwright tests** — ✅ 8 smoke tests added (v176); session detail slide-in smoke test added (v179); tests skip gracefully when E2E account has no solo client record

## Continuity block

### Modal pattern — body-level only
All modals: `document.createElement` → `document.body.appendChild`. Never embed in `el.innerHTML`. See `showAssignProgramModal` as canonical pattern. `class="modal-overlay"` wraps `class="modal-box"`.

### `program_id` constraint
Templates with `program_id` set are hidden from flat Workouts list. Client plan clones: `program_id: null`, `client_id: set`. Master templates: `program_id: set`, `client_id: null`. Standalone: both null.

### Timed sets dual format
`s.duration` = `mm:ss` string (from editor). `s.repsMin` = seconds integer string (from programmatic build). Render must handle both. Pattern: `parseRest(s.duration) || parseInt(s.repsMin)`.

### Dynamic nav — event delegation
`renderNav(role)` rewrites `.sidebar-nav` and `.bottom-nav` innerHTML on every call. Click handlers use event delegation on parent containers — never inline onclick on nav items.

### `_runner` global structure
`{ clientId, name, date, exercises, exIdx, startTime, _timerInterval, _restInterval, _afterRest, lastSession }`
Each exercise: `{ name, type, targetSets, targetReps, targetWeight, loggedSets, bodyweight, sets_json, notes, oneRM, clientNotes }`

### `sets_json` flags
`s.timed` → duration field; `s.unilateral` → L/R split; `s.bodyweight` → BW display; `s.amrap` → AMRAP mode

### `_afterRest` pattern
Between-exercise rests: `() => { _runner.exIdx = nextExIdx; renderRunner() }`. Between-set rests: `skipRestTimer()` calls `renderRunner()` directly.

### `_templateCtx` / `_templateGoBack`
Back-nav context for template editor. Always set `backFn` when opening template from non-standard location. `_templateGoBack` checks: `backFn` → `clientId` → `backTo` → default `'workouts'`.

### Save functions own no navigation
`save*` functions save only. Navigation is role-aware at the call site.

### Master account / solo account
`window._masterAccount = true` when coach user has any client record (coached or personal). `window._soloClientId` = personal client record ID (coach_id = null). `window._masterClientId` = coached client record ID (coach_id set). `currentProfile.role` cycles between `'coach'`, `'client'`, `'solo'` via `switchView()`. `localStorage._activeView` persists choice. Client pill only shown when `_masterClientId` set; Personal pill only when `_soloClientId` set.

### Storage — signed URLs
Private buckets: logos (604800s = 7 days), progress-photos (3600s = 1hr). Never `getPublicUrl`. Use `createSignedUrl` (single) or `createSignedUrls` (batch).

### Cache busting
Each of the 8 module files has its own independent `?v=N`. Any commit that changes a module file must bump that file's own version in index.html — bump only the files that changed, not all 8. Current: core/dashboard/clients v=1 · programs v=5 · calendar-goals v=2 · workouts v=7 · runner v=6 · progress v=3.

### Strength table (Hevy-style runner v1)
`_isPlainStrengthExercise(ex)` gates the table vs. wizard: excludes cardio, any set with `timed`/`unilateral`/`intensityMin`, and carry/sled/lunge-name exercises (regex-matched, same list used elsewhere). `ex.tableRows` = `[{weight, reps, done}]`, lazily built by `_ensureTableRows` (seeded from `_prevSetsByIndex`, keyed by `set_number - 1` against `_runner.lastSession[ex.name]`). `toggleTableSet(i)` flips `done` and calls `_syncLoggedSetsFromTable`, which **rebuilds** `ex.loggedSets` from scratch each time (`filter(done).map({weight,reps})`) rather than pushing — verified safe: every consumer (`saveRunnerSession`, `showRunnerFinish`, header dots) only reads `.length`/iterates, never holds a stale reference. `renderRunnerLastSession` was extended (not just the table added) to retroactively backfill blank rows if the async last-session fetch resolves after the table's first paint — guarded against re-triggering itself (row already non-blank → skip → no re-render loop).

### Periodization — week_number / tier
`program_phases.periodization_type` (`'linear'`/`'undulating'`/null) + `periodization_config` (jsonb). `program_phase_workouts.week_number` (default 1) lets one phase hold distinct day/template assignments per week — phases that never use periodization just have week_number=1 rows, which the client calendar/workouts-page render as repeating every week (legacy behaviour, unchanged). `program_phase_workouts.tier` (`'heavy'`/`'moderate'`/`'light'`) is undulating-only, set per day-slot. `generatePhasePeriodization(phaseId, programId)` clones Week 1's templates into weeks 2..duration_weeks, recalculating only sets where `intensityMin`/`intensityMax` is set — everything else (reps, rest, tempo) is copied unchanged. Regeneration is idempotent (`_cleanupPhaseWeeksBeyond` deletes stale weeks + their templates, both master and any already-propagated client copies, before regenerating) — the same helper runs when a phase's `duration_weeks` is edited down. Client propagation: assigning a program clones week_number through (`_cloneTemplateForClient`/`_cloneProgramForClient`); if a client is *already* assigned when new weeks are generated, `generatePhasePeriodization` propagates to them too.

### 1RM assignment-time check
`_getProgramOneRMStatus(programId, clientId)` scans Week 1 only (sufficient — generated weeks reuse the same exercise names) for %1RM-tagged sets, diffs against `client_1rms` (trim+lowercase exact match — same limitation as the rest of the app; exercise_id-based matching is a deferred future decision, see roadmap). `_renderOneRMQuickEntry(idPrefix, name)` is the shared toggleable kg/Epley-estimate row component — parameterized by idPrefix so multiple rows coexist. `window._missingOneRMExercises` holds the current checklist's missing-name list (index-matched to `mor-N` DOM ids) between refresh and save. `_refreshMissingOneRMs` is token-guarded (`_oneRMRefreshToken`) so a stale in-flight refresh can't overwrite a newer one if the PT changes the client/program selection quickly. Wired into both assign entry points (`showAssignProgramModal`/`showAssignProgramToClientModal`) — 1RM entries must be saved *before* the modal is removed, not after (DOM reads fail silently on a detached modal).

## Open to-dos for Jake

| Action | Priority |
|---|---|
| **GitHub PAT is embedded in plaintext in coachapp's `.git/config` remote URL** (`https://jakendwest-ops:ghp_...@github.com/...`) — noticed while pushing this session, not fixed. Anyone reading that file (backups, screen shares) gets a live token with push access. Rotate to a credential helper or SSH key. | Medium |
| **Other git worktrees created before 2026-07-02 may still auto-start the dead "PT Dashboard" (PTHub) config instead of CoachApp** — today's fix removed it from this worktree + the parent seed template, but existing worktrees weren't swept (unlike the 18-worktree sweep done earlier today for the stale-path bug). Only bites if CoachApp's own server isn't already running when a worktree's preview auto-starts. | Medium |
| Check whether any of Jake's real workout templates use `supersetGroup` — the new strength table doesn't auto-advance to a superset partner the way the old wizard did (by design — table is "tap Next when ready"), so paired exercises need a manual tap between them now. Only worth fixing if real templates actually use supersets. | Medium |
| Live-verify a bodyweight exercise in the new strength table (code-reviewed, not tested against real bodyweight data this session) | Low |
| Run /deploy-check before next beta invite | **High** |
| Tighten `tests/client-workout.spec.js` "session history" locator to be onclick-scoped like its sibling tests (currently text-only match — safe today, would break under Playwright strict mode if a second "Session history" button ever appears) | Low |
| **1RM exercise-name matching — exercise_id vs fuzzy string match** — big design decision, deferred to its own session (see roadmap.md). Today's build keeps name-matching in one shared helper so this swap is contained later. | Medium |
| **`deleteProgram()` doesn't clean up cloned workout_templates** — deleting a program cascades away phases/program_phase_workouts but orphans any templates cloned into it (periodization-generated or otherwise). Found via leftover E2E test debris, not a live bug on Jake's account yet, but will recur for any real program with generated weeks that gets deleted. Fix: before deleting the program, collect template_ids via program_phase_workouts and delete those too. | Medium |
| Verify iOS Safari slide-in fix on real device — `inset:0` replaced with explicit `top/right/bottom/left` in v180, pushed. Test on iPhone and close if working. | **High** |
| Run Rowing/Running/SkiErg DELETE SQL in Supabase (safety check first — see below) | High |
| Update invite-client Edge Function to include PT logo in invite email HTML | Medium |
| Test My Progress Strength tab on live with real data | Medium |
| ICO breach notification procedure — document before beta | Medium |
| Verify `workout_template_exercises` RLS policy exists (check pg_policies for that table) | Medium |
| Upgrade Supabase to Pro plan when ready for beta — unlocks leaked password protection (HaveIBeenPwned) | Low |

**Rowing/Running/SkiErg SQL (run in Supabase SQL editor):**
```sql
-- Step 1: safety check — confirm not in use
SELECT e.name, count(wte.id) as in_use
FROM public.exercises e
LEFT JOIN public.workout_template_exercises wte ON wte.exercise_id = e.id
WHERE e.name IN ('Rowing', 'Running', 'SkiErg')
GROUP BY e.name;
-- Step 2 (only if all counts = 0):
DELETE FROM public.exercises WHERE name IN ('Rowing', 'Running', 'SkiErg');
```
